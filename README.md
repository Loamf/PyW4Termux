# PythonWheels4Termux
Helps to easily install some hard packages like numpy, pillow, etc. â€‹Some other packages available from termux-repo (like opencv-python, scipy, etc)
\----------------------------------
After installing some packages like ninja, cmake, you need to reinstall these packages using
```
pkg reinstall cmake ninja
```

If you want me to upload some other wheels, you can say about it in [issues](https://github.com/Loamf/PyW4Termux/issues)

Some packages are not updated because I'm busy right now.
