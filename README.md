# PythonWheels4Termux
Helps to easily install some hard packages like numpy, pillow, scipy etc. â€‹Some other packages available from termux-repo (like opencv-python, etc)

________________________________________

I added lib libcurl-impersonate-chrome to curl-cffi wheel (PyW4Termux-Data repo) that requires some modules, install them using
```
pkg install rtmpdump libgsasl libpsl openldap
```

If you want me to upload some other wheels, you can say about it in [issues](https://github.com/Loamf/PyW4Termux/issues)
