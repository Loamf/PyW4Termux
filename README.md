Wheels for python in termux (Androidâ€‹ App)

After installing some packages like ninja, cmake, you need to reinstall those packages with 
```
pkg reinstall cmake ninja
```

If you want me to upload some other wheels, you can say about it in [issues](https://github.com/Almaz-Kabirov/wheels-for-python-in-termux/issues)
