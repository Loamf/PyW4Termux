# PythonWheels4Termux
###### Helps you easily install some hard packages like numpy, pillow and etc

After installing some packages like ninja, cmake, you need to reinstall these packages using
```
pkg reinstall cmake ninja
```

If you want me to upload some other wheels, you can say about it in [issues](https://github.com/Almaz-Kabirov/wheels-for-python-in-termux/issues)

Some packages are not updated because I'm busy right now.
